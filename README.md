Example code from [http://markhuge.com/maintainable-rich-html-email-templates-with-grunt/](http://markhuge.com/maintainable-rich-html-email-templates-with-grunt/). This is pretty much the same code we're using in dev, minus our deployment tasks.

Gruntfile assumes source files be the following file structure:

```
gruntfile.coffee
src/
 |-- jade/
 |-- sass/
```
